Training Performance
- The UNet model was trained for 50 epochs using MSELoss in Google Colab, with wandb tracking.
- Initial metrics (Epoch 0): Train Loss: 0.2588, Val Loss: 0.2376, Train SSIM: 0.3260, Val SSIM: 0.6288.
- Final metrics (Epoch 49): Train Loss: 0.0081, Val Loss: 0.0571, Train SSIM: 0.8426, Val SSIM: 0.8182.
- Loss decreased steadily (Train: 0.2588 to 0.0081, Val: 0.2376 to 0.0571), with SSIM improving (Train: 0.3260 to 0.8426, Val: 0.6288 to 0.8182), reflecting robust learning and structural similarity enhancement.

Inference Results
- Predictions closely match ground truth for existing combinations (e.g., `yellow_star.png`), with high SSIM (~0.82) supporting visual fidelity.
- For unseen combinations (e.g., `green_star.png`), the model generates reasonable predictions, though accuracy cannot be validated without ground truth.

Observations
- The model shows strong generalization, with validation SSIM stabilizing above 0.8 after Epoch 20, though early validation loss spikes (e.g., Epoch 3: 0.3057) suggest potential overfitting or dataset imbalance.
- User input in `validation.py` effectively handles available shapes and colors, with a fallback to prediction-only mode when ground truth is absent.
- Colabâ€™s environment facilitated training, with the final model saved as `final_unet_model.pth`

Recommendations
- Address validation loss spikes by augmenting the dataset with more diverse color-shape pairs or adjusting regularization.
- Extend training beyond 50 epochs if resources allow, monitoring for further SSIM gains.
- Create manual ground truth for unseen combinations to evaluate prediction quality quantitatively.
